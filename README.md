# Dotfiles

This repository contains my configuration files (dotfiles) for different applications.\
Each application has its own dedicated folder with specific configuration files and documentation.

## Why

I don't like having an environment I can't easily reproduce, so I store the config files for the applications that require the most amount of work to configure.

It's also a good way to perhaps help others how to configure their own environments.

## How

Each sub-folder in this repo contains the config files for a specific application, with detailed instructions on how to set them up.\
You will however most likely need to adapt them to your own environment!

*These configurations are tailored to my personal workflow and preferences. Feel free to adapt them to your needs.*
